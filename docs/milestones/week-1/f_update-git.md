   # Customer Support Chatbot with RAG

   A specialized customer support chatbot that leverages company documents to provide accurate responses. The system uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant information from the knowledge base before generating answers.

   ## Technology Stack

   - **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3
   - **Backend**: Django 5.2
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - **LLM**: Llama 3 with OpenAI fallback
   - **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) and DigitalOcean (backend)

   ## Development Setup

   ### Prerequisites

   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Git

   ### Getting Started

   1. Clone the repository:
   ```

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot.git
   cd ai-chatbot

   ```

   2. Run the setup script:
   ```

   ./scripts/setup.sh

   ```

   3. Start the development environment:
   ```

   ./scripts/dev.sh

   ```

   4. Access the applications:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
   - Admin Interface: http://localhost:8000/admin

   ### Development Workflow

   1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```

   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

   ```

   2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```

   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"

   ```

   3. Push your branch and create a pull request:
   ```

   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

   ```

   4. Once reviewed and approved, your changes will be merged into `develop`.

## Commit and Push Changes

1. Commit all changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Week 1: Project setup and knowledge base foundation"
   ```

2. Push to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin develop
   ```

## Week 1 Deliverables Verification

Before considering Week 1 complete, verify that all required deliverables are in place:

- [x] Project repository initialized with proper structure
- [] Docker development environment configured
- [x] Database schema designed and initial migrations created
- [x] Document models implemented
- [x] Basic Django project structure set up
- [x] Next.js project scaffolded
- [] Initial CI/CD pipeline configuration

All these components provide the foundation for the Customer Support Chatbot project and set the stage for Week 2, where you'll implement the document processing pipeline.
