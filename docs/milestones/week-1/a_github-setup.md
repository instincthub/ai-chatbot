# Week 1 Implementation Guide: Project Setup and Knowledge Base Foundation

This guide provides detailed steps for implementing the first week of the Customer Support Chatbot project. By the end of this week, you'll have established the project foundation including repository structure, development environment, database models, and initial application scaffolding.

## 1. Project Repository Initialization

### 1.1 Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub

   ```bash
   # Repository name: ai-chatbot
   # Visibility: Private
   # Add README.md, .gitignore (Python, Node), and LICENSE
   ```

2. Clone the repository locally

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/instincthub/ai-chatbot.git
   cd ai-chatbot
   ```

3. Create the basic project structure

   ```bash
   mkdir -p backend chatbot_frontend docs infrastructure
   touch README.md
   ```

4. Create an initial README.md with project overview

   ```markdown
   # Customer Support Chatbot with RAG

   A specialized customer support chatbot that leverages company documents to provide accurate responses. The system uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant information from the knowledge base before generating answers.

   ## Project Structure

   - `/chatbot_backend` - Django 5.2 application
   - `/chatbot_frontend` - Next.js 15.3 application
   - `/docs` - Project documentation
   - `/infrastructure` - Docker and deployment configurations
   ```

5. Push initial structure to the repository

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initialize project structure"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. Create development branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop
   git push origin develop
   ```

### 1.2 Set Up Branch Protection Rules

1. Go to repository Settings > Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators
