## Sample Conversation Flows

The following examples demonstrate how the chatbot handles different types of customer interactions using RAG technology to retrieve and leverage relevant information from the knowledge base.

### Example 1: Basic Product Information Query

**Customer:**  
"What are the differences between your Basic and Professional plans?"

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**

```
Our subscription plans include:

Basic Plan ($19/month):
- Up to 5 users
- 20GB storage
- Basic reporting
- Email support

Professional Plan ($49/month):
- Up to 20 users
- 100GB storage
- Advanced analytics
- Priority email and chat support
- API access
- Custom integrations
```

**Chatbot:**  
"Our Basic and Professional plans have several key differences:

• **Users:** Basic supports up to 5 users, while Professional allows up to 20 users.
• **Storage:** Basic provides 20GB storage, Professional offers 100GB.
• **Support:** Basic includes email support, while Professional adds priority email and chat support.
• **Features:** Professional adds advanced analytics, API access, and custom integrations that aren't available in Basic.

The Basic plan costs $19/month and the Professional plan is $49/month. Would you like more information about any specific feature?"

**Customer:**  
"Does the Professional plan include phone support?"

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: support_options.md*  
```
Support channels by plan:
- Basic Plan: Email support (48-hour response time)
- Professional Plan: Priority email (24-hour response time) and live chat support
- Enterprise Plan: Dedicated account manager and 24/7 phone support
```

**Chatbot:**  
"The Professional plan doesn't include phone support. It offers priority email support with 24-hour response time and live chat support. Phone support is only available with our Enterprise plan, which also includes a dedicated account manager. Would you like me to provide more details about the Enterprise plan or our support options?"

### Example 2: Technical Troubleshooting

**Customer:**  
"I'm getting a 'connection failed' error when trying to sync my data."

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: troubleshooting_guide.md*  
```
Common Connection Errors:

Connection Failed Error:
This typically occurs due to one of the following reasons:
1. Network connectivity issues
2. Incorrect API credentials
3. Firewall blocking connection
4. Service outage

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API key is correct and active
3. Check if your firewall is blocking ports 443 or 8443
4. Visit our status page (status.ourproduct.com) to check for service issues
```

**Chatbot:**  
"I'm sorry you're experiencing a connection failed error. This typically happens due to one of several reasons:

1. **Network issues:** Check your internet connection is working properly
2. **API credentials:** Verify your API key is correct and hasn't expired
3. **Firewall settings:** Your firewall might be blocking ports 443 or 8443
4. **Service status:** We might be experiencing service disruptions

Could you try checking your internet connection and verifying your API credentials first? You can also visit our status page at status.ourproduct.com to see if there are any known service issues."

**Customer:**  
"I checked my internet and it's working fine. How do I verify my API key?"

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: api_documentation.md*  
```
API Key Management:

To verify your API key:
1. Log in to your account dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > API
3. Check that your key is listed as "Active"
4. If the key shows "Expired" or "Inactive", generate a new key
5. Copy the new key and update it in your integration settings
```

**Chatbot:**  
"To verify your API key, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to your account dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Integrations > API
3. Check if your key is listed as 'Active'
4. If it shows 'Expired' or 'Inactive', you'll need to generate a new key
5. Copy the new key and update it in your integration settings

If your key is already active but you're still experiencing the error, would you like me to help you check if there might be a firewall issue?"

### Example 3: Account Management

**Customer:**  
"I need to update my billing information."

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**

"You can update your billing information by following these steps:

1. Log in to your account
2. Click your profile icon in the top right corner
3. Select 'Account Settings'
4. Go to the 'Billing' tab
5. Click 'Edit' next to Payment Method
6. Enter your new payment details and click 'Save'

The changes will take effect immediately, and your next invoice will use the updated payment method. Is there anything specific about billing you need help with?"

**Customer:**  
"When will my next payment be charged?"

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: billing_faq.md*  
```
Billing Cycles:

Payments are processed on the monthly anniversary of your subscription start date. For example, if you subscribed on January 15th, your next payment would be processed on February 15th.

You can view your next billing date from your Account Settings > Billing > Subscription Details.
```

**Chatbot:**  
"Your next payment will be charged on the monthly anniversary of your subscription start date. For example, if you signed up on the 15th of the month, you'll be charged on the 15th of each subsequent month.

You can check the exact date by going to Account Settings > Billing > Subscription Details, where you'll see your next billing date displayed.

Would you like me to help you with anything else related to your billing?"

### Example 4: Complex Technical Question with Escalation

**Customer:**  
"I'm trying to set up the custom workflow integration with Salesforce but keep getting an authentication error."

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: integrations_guide.md*  
```
Salesforce Integration:

Common authentication errors:
- Invalid OAuth token
- Insufficient permissions in Salesforce
- Incorrect API version
- IP restrictions on the Salesforce side

Basic troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify Connected App settings in Salesforce
2. Check OAuth scopes include api, refresh_token, offline_access
3. Ensure the integration user has API Enabled permission
4. Check if IP restrictions are enabled in Salesforce setup
```

**Chatbot:**  
"I understand you're having trouble with Salesforce authentication for the custom workflow integration. This usually happens due to one of these reasons:

1. Invalid OAuth token
2. Insufficient permissions in Salesforce
3. Incorrect API version
4. IP restrictions on Salesforce

Could you try these troubleshooting steps:
- Verify your Connected App settings in Salesforce
- Check that OAuth scopes include: api, refresh_token, and offline_access
- Ensure your integration user has the 'API Enabled' permission
- Check if there are IP restrictions enabled in your Salesforce setup

If you've tried these steps already or need more specific guidance, I'd be happy to connect you with one of our integration specialists who can help with your specific configuration."

**Customer:**  
"I've checked all of that already. I need someone to look at my specific setup."

**[INTERNAL: Escalation Determination]**  
*Escalation criteria met:*
- Technical complexity beyond standard troubleshooting
- Customer has already attempted standard solutions
- Integration-specific configuration likely required

**Chatbot:**  
"I understand you need more specialized assistance with your Salesforce integration. I'll connect you with one of our integration specialists who can provide more in-depth support with your specific configuration.

I'm creating a support ticket now, and a specialist will reach out to you within the next 4 business hours. They'll contact you via the email address associated with your account.

Your ticket number is #45289. Is there any additional information about your setup that would be helpful to include in the ticket?"

### Example 5: Product Feature Guidance

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: reporting_guide.md*  
```
Creating Custom Reports:

1. Navigate to the Reports section in the left sidebar
2. Click the "+ New Report" button
3. Select a report type (e.g., User Activity, Sales Performance)

```

**Chatbot:**  
"Creating a custom report is straightforward:

2. Click the '+ New Report' button
3. Select your report type (User Activity, Sales Performance, etc.)
4. Drag the metrics you want from the left panel

Pro tip: You can schedule reports to be automatically generated and emailed on a recurring basis by using the 'Schedule' feature after saving.

Would you like more details about any specific part of this process?"

**Customer:**  
"Can I combine data from different sources in one report?"

**[INTERNAL: Retrieved Knowledge]**  
*Source: advanced_reporting.md*  
```
Data Blending in Reports:

Professional and Enterprise plans support data blending from multiple sources:
1. Create a new report
2. Click "Add Data Source" after selecting your initial data source
3. Choose the secondary data source
4. Define the relationship field that connects both sources
5. Continue adding metrics and dimensions from either source

Note: Data blending requires a common field between sources (e.g., User ID, Date, etc.)
```

**Chatbot:**  
"Yes, you can combine data from different sources in one report if you have a Professional or Enterprise plan. This feature is called data blending:

1. Start creating a new report
2. After selecting your initial data source, click 'Add Data Source'
3. Choose your secondary data source
4. Define the relationship field that connects both sources (this is important - you need a common field like User ID or Date)
5. You can then add metrics and dimensions from either source in your report

This allows you to create more comprehensive reports that draw insights from multiple data sources. Is this the kind of combined reporting you're looking to create?"
