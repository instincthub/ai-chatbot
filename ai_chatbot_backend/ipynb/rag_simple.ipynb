    "## 🎉 Simple RAG System Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What This Version Provides:\n",
    "- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only uses basic langchain and chromadb\n",
    "- **No Compilation Issues**: Works on Windows without Rust/C++ requirements\n",
    "- **Local Storage**: Uses ChromaDB for local vector storage\n",
    "- **Simple Embeddings**: Basic demonstration embeddings (replace with real ones in production)\n",
    "- **No LLM Required**: Simple keyword-based answer extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Upgrading to Production:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Better Embeddings**: Replace SimpleEmbeddings with:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Option 1: Use OpenAI (requires API key)\n",
    "   from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\n",
    "   embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Option 2: Use local embeddings (when dependencies work)\n",
    "   from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n",
    "   embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add LLM for Better Answers**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Local LLM (when dependencies work)\n",
    "   from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp\n",
    "   llm = LlamaCpp(model_path=\"./models/llama-2-7b.bin\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Pinecone for Cloud Storage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone\n",
    "   vectorstore = Pinecone.from_documents(documents, embeddings)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Notes:\n",
    "- This is a simplified version for development/testing\n",
    "- The embeddings are basic - use real embeddings for better results\n",
    "- Answer generation is keyword-based - add LLM for natural responses\n",
    "- ChromaDB stores vectors locally in `./chroma_db` directory"
